# üë§ Individual Report ‚Äì Project Contribution

### üß± My Contributions

During the development of the Gym Management System, I actively contributed to the following parts of the project, while having help from my group in various parts throughout:

- **Member Functionality**
  - Focused on the development and refinement of features related to the `Member` role.
  - Helped create and update the logic for how members interact with workout classes and memberships.

- **GymApp Menu Integration**
  - Implemented and refined the **Member Menu** interface to ensure users could navigate clearly.
  - Added logic to **prevent the menu from resetting** after an option was selected, allowing smoother navigation and user experience.
  - Ensured that the "Back to Main Menu" and "Exit" functions worked correctly without causing unexpected behavior.

- **Testing & Debugging**
  - Helped test the Member flow from login through all functional options.
  - Verified that inputs were handled correctly and errors were displayed properly.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- **Menu Navigation and Flow**
  - One of the main challenges was ensuring the menu remained persistent and user-friendly without restarting the whole app after each action.

- **Console-Based User Experience**
  - Creating a fluid experience in the console required extra attention to detail in how user input and navigation prompts were managed.

- **Role-Specific Isolation**
  - Making sure that Member-specific features remained isolated and secure (not accessible by other roles) took some thoughtful logic control.
